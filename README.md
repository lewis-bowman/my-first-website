# My Very First Website

Welcome!

## Description

As the title suggests, my very first web page created with Code Institute.

Comprising of three sections, it names the different coding languages as required in the course.

The only challenge I faced was sizing the images so that they did not appear out of proportion on the webpage.

### Languages Used

To create the webpage, I used the following languages:

HTML5

CSS3

Git
